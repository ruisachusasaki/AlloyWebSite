The "Chaos-to-Unity" Scroll Animation Prompt
Objective: Build a high-performance, scroll-linked animation component using React and Framer Motion that visualizes the transition from "SaaS Chaos" to a "Unified System."

1. The Asset Array: Create a constant array of objects containing the logos/icons for: Notion, Zapier, Airtable, Google Sheets, HubSpot, Trello, Clickup, Slack, WhatsApp, Tokko Broker, Mercado Libre, and Asana. * Technical Note: Use high-quality SVGs or icons from simple-icons via a CDN.

2. State 1: The "Chaos" (Initial View):

Positioning: Use absolute positioning to scatter these icons randomly across a container (height: 100vh). Apply random rotation (e.g., -20deg to 20deg) and random scale (0.8 to 1.2) to each.

The Web: Use an SVG layer in the background to draw "messy," tangled lines (strokes) connecting these icons. The lines should look like a disorganized spiderweb, overlapping and jagged.

3. The Scroll Logic (Framer Motion):

Use the useScroll hook to track the vertical scroll progress of this specific section.

Use useTransform to map the scroll progress (0 to 1) to the following properties for every icon:

X and Y Coordinates: Transition from their random "Chaos" positions to (0, 0) (the center of the screen).

Rotation: Transition from random angles to 0deg.

Opacity: As they reach the center, the individual icons should slightly fade out or "merge."

The Web Transition: The messy SVG lines should shrink in length and opacity as the scroll progresses, eventually disappearing when the icons unify.

4. State 2: The "Unified" (End View):

Once the scroll reaches 100%, all icons should be stacked/merged at the center.

At the moment of impact (center), trigger a "Pulse" effect or a "Glow" behind a new, larger icon that represents "My Unified Platform" (use a clean, geometric abstract icon).

Text Overlay: As they unify, reveal a large, bold headline: "One System. No Chaos."

5. Performance & Interaction:

Ensure the animation is bi-directional. Scrolling back up must perfectly reverse the icons back into their original "Chaos" positions and regenerate the messy web.

Use stiffness: 100 and damping: 30 in the transition settings to ensure the movement feels "heavy" and premium, not "floaty."

Ensure the container is sticky (position: sticky) so the user stays in the animation frame while scrolling through the transition.
