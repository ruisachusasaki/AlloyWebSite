Role: You are an expert Senior Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer specializing in minimalist, high-end "Productized Service" websites.

Project Goal: Create a world-class, single-page landing page for my new business. The business builds custom, unified software platforms that replace a client's "SaaS Chaos" (Airtable, HubSpot, Zapier, etc.) with a single, bespoke internal tool.

Design Aesthetic (The "Beyond Capacity" Look):

Style: Ultra-minimalist, Apple-esque, or "Linear.app" aesthetic.

Color Palette: Deep Slate/Black background with subtle glassmorphism (transparency) and high-contrast white/silver typography. Use a single accent color (like Electric Blue or Emerald Green) for buttons.

Typography: Large, bold, sans-serif headings (Inter or Geist). High whitespace to let the content breathe.

Animations: Implement smooth scroll-reveals and subtle hover transitions.

Website Structure & Copy:

Hero Section: * Headline: "Stop duct-taping your business together with 10 different apps."

Sub-headline: "I build the one platform that does it all—exactly how you work. Replace your messy tech stack with a single, custom-coded digital backbone."

CTA Button: "Book a 15-minute System Audit."

The "Chaos vs. Clarity" Section: * Create a visual comparison. On the left: "The Chaos" (List logos like Airtable, HubSpot, Zapier, Slack, Sheets). On the right: "The Clarity" (A single, glowing branded box representing the custom platform).

Copy: "Don't hire someone to manage your tools. Hire a system that manages itself."

The Service (The "Unlimited" Model):

Explain the $1,000/month value: "One flat fee. Unlimited modifications. Zero technical debt."

Bullet points: Custom CRM & ERP, Automated Workflows, Integrated Payments, 24/7 Developer Support.

Why It’s Better: * Emphasis: "We don't just build it; we evolve it. As your business changes, the software changes with you—included in your subscription."

Footer: * Clean, minimalist contact form and a "Powered by [Your Name/Business Name]" sign-off.

Technical Requirements:

Use React with Tailwind CSS.

Use Lucide-react for clean, thin-stroke icons.

Ensure the design is fully responsive (perfect on mobile).

Add a subtle "Glassmorphism" navbar that blurs the background on scroll.

How to use this in Replit:
Open a new project in Replit.

Select "Replit Agent" (or the Chat/Builder feature).

Paste the prompt above.

Once the first version is built, tell it: "Now, make the typography 20% larger and add a subtle glowing gradient effect behind the Hero Section to make it look more premium."
