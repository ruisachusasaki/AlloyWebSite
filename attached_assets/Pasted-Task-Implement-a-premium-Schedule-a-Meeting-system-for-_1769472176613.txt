Task: Implement a premium "Schedule a Meeting" system for my website.1. Trigger & UI (Form-First Flow):Trigger: When the "Join the Waitlist" button is clicked, open a super-clean, premium modal (Apple-inspired: glassmorphism effect, subtle transitions, and refined typography).Step 1 (Form): Collect User Name, Email, and a Textarea for "Business Description/Goals."Step 2 (Scheduling): After form submission, transition smoothly to a custom calendar to pick a time slot.2. Smart Availability (30-Min Meeting with Custom Buffers):Integration: Connect to the Google Calendar API using ruisasaki0@gmail.com. Since other calendars (rui@themediaoptimizers.com and rui@boostmode.com) are shared with this account, check availability across all three.Duration: All available slots must be 30 minutes long.Buffer Constraints: A slot is only "Available" if:There is at least a 45-minute gap of free time before the meeting starts.There is at least a 15-minute gap of free time after the meeting ends.3. Automation:Calendar Action: Upon selecting a time, create a Google Meet event on ruisasaki0@gmail.com and invite the user.Email Notification: Use Nodemailer to send a summary email to ruisasaki0@gmail.com containing the User's Name, Email, chosen Time, and their "Business Description."4. Premium Polish:Include a "success" state with a high-end checkmark animation.Handle "Busy" states gracefully with a loading skeleton while the API calculates availability based on the buffer rules.Technical Note: Use a Node.js backend on Replit. Specify the exact Secrets (Environment Variables) needed for Google OAuth (Client ID, Secret, Refresh Token) and the SMTP mailer.Pro-Tip for your 45/15 rule:When Replit writes the logic, make sure it uses the freebusy query or list events for all three calendar IDs. Since you're a lead dev, you'll appreciate that calculating a "45-min gap before" means the code needs to look for the end time of the previous event and ensure:$$(StartTime_{NewMeeting} - EndTime_{PreviousEvent}) \ge 45\text{ minutes}$$
